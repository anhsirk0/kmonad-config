# Kmonad config

This is my configuration for kmonad

It has 2 layers
 - QWERTY
 - CTRLALT
 
#### QWERTY Layer
 - The default layer
 - `ESC` and `CAPSLOCK` are swapped
 - `CTRL` and `ALT` are swapped
 - holding `CAPSLOCK` will toggle `CTRLALT` layer

#### CTRLALT Layer
 - Toggled by holding `CAPSLOCK`
 - Works same as holding `CTRL` and `ALT`
 - Example: Pressing `CAPSLOCK + A` will work as `CTRL + ALT + A`
